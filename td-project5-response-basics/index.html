            <h2>P.U.B.G</h2>
            <p>This is also s a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players.</p> 
            <p> This online game is compatible with both android and a console, but it is not recognised due to the choppy graphics.</p>
            <p>And the console version also lags alot, so i will not recommend this game is you have this options available.</p>
            <p>This is "Not Destiny Approved" if you have options.</p>
